    "trials: it describes the situation where there are only two possible outcomes $x\\in \\left \\{ 0,1 \\right \\}$ which are referred to as \"failure\" and \"success.\"  In machine vision, the Bernoulli distribution could be used to model the data. For example, it might describe the probability of a pixel taking an intensity value of greater or less than 128 _(threshold)_. Alternatively, it could be used to model the state of the world. For example, it might describe the probability that a face is present or absent in the image.\n",
